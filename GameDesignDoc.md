	* Purple-colored ship with X across the front
	* Does not fire bullets
	* When killed, will immediately drop down off the screen in an attempt to kill the user (user dies on collision)
5. Projectile

	* Exists until it collides with another object
	* Depending on ship that fires it, different image
	* Hearts are "neutral" projectiles that are slower than other projectiles
	* _Insert Images Here w/ Ship reference_

Notes:
* All ships excluding mothership will be given the same (relatively slow) speed, but velocity is randomly generated.

## How to play the game
* Keyboard Gameplay
* Option to choose between WASD or Arrow Keys
* Either way, space to shoot
* Esc to bring up the menu, which is mouse-navigated

## How the score changes
* Score is calculated by the ship killed
	* Blue - 100pt
	* Green - 150pt
	* Purple - 300pt
	* Red - 1000pt
* Score will be cut in half if you lose all your lives and choose to continue
* Each game only has ONE continue. This is hidden to the user, but they will only be prompted ONCE to continue after death.

## How to keep track of lives
* Each user starts with 3 lives (that is, 2 hearts in the life counter)
* Purple and Red ships VERY INFREQUENTLY drop hearts, which can be picked up for a life
* Each user can have a maximum of 4 extra lives (lives after that will fully heal the user)
* When a user's HP drops to/below zero, they lose a life, and HP will be restored to 100%. 
* The game ends when the user runs out of lives.

Note: When the user has 1 heart, that means if they lose that heart, they will have 0 hearts remaining. They can play with 0 hearts, but the game ends after they run out of HP having no hearts. (Look at it like they are using their last life, with zero backup lives remaining.) 

## Layout of UI
* Menus
	* Start Menu
		* BUttons
	* Pause Menu
		* Buttons
	* End Menu
		* Buttons
* Actions
	* What does this mean ):
* Other UI Components

* What they do
