Notes:
* All ships excluding mothership will be given the same (relatively slow) speed, but initial velocity is randomly generated.
* Player's bullet starts with attack 1, then doubles with each level to a max of 8 (where every ship will die with one hit.)
* Player starts with initial HP 10, which increases by 5 each level
* Initially, each ship bullet starts with attack 1 (with mothership being attack = 2) and this will double each level.
* When a ship dies, it will flash twice (OFF ON OFF ON OFF) before disappearing from the game. During this time, all bullets will be absorbed by the ship.)
* On respawn, player has blinking invincibility for 5 blinks (ON OFF x5 + CONSTANT ON).

## How to play the game

* Levels
	* Levels are reached after a player kills all blue/green/purple ships on screen. 
	* Levels are referred to as waves in the game
	* Wave 1 starts with 10 b/g/p ships on screen, and this will increase by 5 each level until a maximum of 25 b/g/p ships are on the screen. 
*Increasing Difficulty
	* Timer will control the speed of the ships and bullets, which will make each level more difficult
	* More ships will be added each level
	* Enemy ships will also fire more frequently each level
* Player Controls
	* Player can only move around and shoot, no extra abilities
	* Player can only move in a region below the ship spaw region, so they cannot be "above" the enemy
* Technical Gameplay
	* Keyboard Gameplay
	* Arrow keys to move and space to shoot
	* Esc to open/close the pause menu
	* All menus are mouse-navigated only

## How the score changes
* Score is calculated by the ship killed
	* Blue - 100pt
	* Green - 150pt
	* Purple - 300pt
	* Red - 1000pt
* Picking up a heart gives 500pts
* Currently there are no ways for score to decrease

## How to keep track of lives
* Each user starts with 3 lives (that is, 2 hearts in the life counter)
* Red ships drop hearts upon death about 50% of the time, which can be picked up for a life
* Each user can have a maximum of 4 extra lives (lives after that will fully heal the user)
* When a user's HP drops to/below zero, they lose a life, and HP will be restored to 100%. 
* The game ends when the user runs out of lives.

Note: When the user has 1 heart, that means if they lose that heart, they will have 0 hearts remaining. They can play with 0 hearts, but the game ends after they run out of HP having no hearts. (Look at it like they are using their last life, with zero backup lives remaining.)
