## Overview
Title: Starships (were meant to fly...)

A high-contrast themed shooting game based on Galaga and similar games. The player is a lone ship, ![Player Ship](images/actualplayer.png), that must try to survive against waves of invading spaceships.

5. Projectile

6. Beam
	* Movement
		* Initial (root) point does not move
		* Beam grows until it reaches the bottom of the screen or a ship
	* Characteristics
		* Only fired by the red ship
		* Will stop growing on contact with the player
	* Appearance
		* ![Rainbow Bullet](images/rainbow.png)
	* Note: implemented in the game as a series of bullets that are fired frequently enough that they produce a long beam. Not technically a thing, but I felt that it was necessary to document it as a separate thing.

Notes:
* All ships excluding mothership will be given the same (relatively slow) speed, but initial velocity is randomly generated.
* Player's bullet starts with attack 1, then increases by 1 each level.
* Player starts with initial HP 10, which increases by 5 each level
* Initially, each ship bullet starts with attack 1 which inceases by 1 each level. Mothership is always double the base attack.
* On respawn, player has blinking invincibility for 5 blinks (ON OFF x5 + CONSTANT ON).

## How to play the game

* Levels
	* Levels are reached after a player kills all ships on screen. 
	* Levels are referred to as waves in the game
	* All waves are 17 ships each (not counting the mothership), the position and numbers of each ship are randomly generated
	* Player is healed between levels
* Increasing Difficulty
	* Timer speeds up each level, making everything move faster
	* Attacks of each ship increase each level
* Player Controls
	* Player can only move around and shoot, no extra abilities
	* Player can only move in a region below the ship spaw region, so they cannot be "above" the enemy
* Technical Gameplay
	* Keyboard Gameplay
	* Arrow keys to move and space to shoot
	* Esc to pause/unpause the game

## How the score changes
* Score is calculated by the ship killed
	* Blue - 100pt
	* Green - 150pt
	* Purple - 300pt
	* Red - 1000pt

## How to keep track of lives
* Each user starts with 3 lives
* When a user's HP drops to/below zero, they lose a life, and HP will be restored to 100%. 
* The game ends when the user runs out of lives

## Layout of UI
* Buttons
	* Start - Will start/restart the game
	* Pause - Will pause/unpause the game
	* Quit - Will exit the application
* Actions
	* Arrow keys to move in gameplay
	* Spacebar to shoot in gameplay
	* Esc to toggle pause
* HP Indicator
	* Shows the current HP%
* Hearts Bar
	* Shows the number of hearts in red
* Score indicator
	* Shows the current numerical score
